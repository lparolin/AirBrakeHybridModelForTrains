# An Air Brake Hybrid Model for Trains

The code contains a proposed benchmark submitted to the workshop on Applied Verification for Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2015. The full paper can be found at https://easychair.org/publications/paper/4H 

 * The file run_me.py is responsible for configuring the train, the path, and the brake with their parameters, for executing the simulation, and generating the final graphs. 
 * The files brake.py and train.py provide a possible implementation of the air brake and of the train models discussed in the paper. 
 * The file trainpath.py can be used to generate test paths for the train.

The proposed Python implementation is provided as an example to facilitate the adoption of the proposed benchmark. 
The code has been developed for the sole purposes of this workshop. 

The authors are grateful for any help aimed to improve the code quality.
